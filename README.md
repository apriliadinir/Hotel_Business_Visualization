# Hotel_Business_Visualization

It is essential for any company to continually analyse its business performance. This project focuses on understanding customer behaviour when booking hotels and how it relates to hotel reservation cancellation rates. The insights gathered will be presented through data visualisations to ensure they are easy to interpret.
